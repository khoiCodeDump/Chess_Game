# Chess_Game
Multiplayer chess game. The chess game follows peer to peer architecture and is a live game .

## Set up & Installation

Make sure you have Java SE 17 & JDK 17 installed. I am using eclipse to launch the project. Note this is a maven project so the dependencies may need to be installed in your machine.
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
```
Install the required maven dependency:
```bash
<dependency>
  		<groupId>org.apache.xmlgraphics</groupId>
  		<artifactId>batik-all</artifactId>
  		<version>1.17</version>
</dependency>
```
## Running the application
You can either run this in the command line or eclipse but I recommend running it in eclipse. From eclipse, you can get the command to run it in the command line in Run Configurations.
Note, the server has to be run first in order for you to run the client. Once the server is running, you can connect to the server with any machine in your local network. 
The app is not yet world wide and would not work if someone is trying to connect to the server outside of your network.
